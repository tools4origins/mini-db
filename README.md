## MiniDB

A very small database based on [Designing Data-Intensive Application](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032175.do) "simplest database".

The only two available operations are `get` and `put`. 

### Usage

	$ source minidb.sh
	$ put key value
	$ get key # returns value


This readme file is 370% bigger than the database source code :).
